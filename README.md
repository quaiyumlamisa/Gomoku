Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board.
It can be played using the 15×15 board[1] or the 19×19 board.[2] Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played
as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.
